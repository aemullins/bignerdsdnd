			Magic Refinery 1 - out of commission
		</div>
       	<ul>
            <li>the charred husk of what once used to be a factory sits in the middle of what look to the naked eye to be abandoned homes and businesses</li>
            <li>this refinery used to be as prolific as its sister, if not more, but something went wrong with the process of imbuing pure magic into a precious stone and resulted in an explosion, burning out the factory and causing the town to be evacuated. The surrounding town is polluted with residue magic, which occasionally reacts with the various man-made objects that were abandoned. This magic is wild and hard to contain, and is the reason why the town is still abandoned even though it’s been years since the explosion.</li>
            <li>most people in the farming villages nearby believe this town is haunted, roamed by the gods, or other supernatural beings based on stories told by people who had gone into the abandoned town</li>
            <ul>
                <li>some have heard unnatural sounds, sounding especially as if they come from the husk of a factory; others have seen strange shapes or shadows where they don’t make sense, and always moving</li>
                <li>some people blame it on the priests/clerics that seem to travel there, most young and trying to understand and come up with a solution for the pollutant magic, and some older, keeping track of the damage of the wild magic</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>although, some small villages have experiences with some greedy priests, older clerics who ask for too much and answer too little when questioned, some villages have responded with a protector to keep their families safe, while others simply follow the priests’ demands</li>
                </ul>
