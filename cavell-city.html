            Cavell City, Capitol
        </div>
   	    <p><strong>QUICK BACKGROUND -</strong><br>
        Cavell City is the capital city of Cavell, expanded far out beyond the walls of its former castle as tech progressed and jobs changed. It is still ruled by an Emperor or Empress, who reside in the Palace of Cavell City. Just recently, the crown prince has taken power and become the new Emperor after the untimely death of the Empress and consort. He and his twin sister do their best to rule over the land with the help of some very trusty advisors. The line of rulers has always been caring, taking to heart the fact there is no ruler without the people, and this new Emperor seems no different, even if he is still quite young.</p>
        <p><b>CAVELL</b><br>
        castle town/main city - (think like rome or athens in terms of old but still bustling and integrated tech into old buildings, and also in terms of dirt)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>very large city, has obviously greatly expanded over the years:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Inner Wall/Palace:</b> contains the palace and the wall around it. The palace used to be more of a castle in terms of defenses, having a wall as well as small windows and thick walls, but over the many years of Emperors and Empresses, the place has be renovated over and over to become far more open and airy, turning it into a palace rather than a castle. But there are still some remnants of the original building found in the ancient wall around the palace and the even more built over wall in the middle of the city.</li>
                <li><b>City:</b> just outside the inner wall from the original castle. This part of the city is the oldest, but is definitely full of the wealthier inhabitants of the city (good luck getting cheap real estate when the buildings have a bunch of land and are centuries old but almost always upgraded with the times). This is definitely where lords and people who work on designing new constructs live, and it’s also where all the temples are located (along with most of the people who live in the temples). As the buildings go further away from the inner wall, the more cramped they become, obviously shoved together as close as they can to maximise the quickly overtaken space. These buildings go right up against the outer wall, some newer ones going over it.</li>
                <li><b>Outskirts:</b> outside the outer wall, the city expanded into towns around factories that eventually all ran into each other, and the buildings closest to the wall always look the most jumbled. The buildings out here however are newer, and often smaller to try to fit more into the space, although as you go out towards the edge the buildings start getting bigger as they have more space to develop. This is where most of the poorer folk live, and sometimes the factory owners as well if they desire to live near their factory (most do not).</li>
            </ul>
            <li>as you go into the city, the further into the city you go, the more tech you see, until you hit the palace, which has far more integrated/disguised tech to kind of meld both the old and the new</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Notable Places:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cavell Palace:</li>
                <ul>
                <li>A beautiful place, the architecture itself shows its majesty, making no need for gaudy decorations. The Emperors and Empresses of old decided to keep their money to help the city and its people instead of spending it on gaudy decorations, and since then it has been their heritage to continue with that example. (Some of the renovations of the castle were definitely made during a time when people were desperate for work.)</li>
                <li>It’s always bustling with workers, from servants to guards to advisors, making halls abuzz with conversation and gossip. There are also often cats (rat-catchers) and occasionally off-duty hunting dogs running around as well, usually causing trouble. At later hours the halls tend to quiet, but there’s almost always a few people running around doing various jobs even in the wee hours of the morning.</li>
                <li>It’s a grand place that has a lot of employees and is its own little community almost. (Some of the estates near the palace’s wall are similar, though a few are more abandoned.)</li>
                <li>things told to new people in the palace:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Emperor and his twin sister the Princess wander around the halls and look just like everyone else, so watch what you say.</li>
                    <li>If you make eye contact with the Emperor while he sits on the throne you’ll be smited on the spot.</li>
                    <li>The Princess has claimed all of the animals in the palace as her own so if you touch one you’ll be thrown in the dungeon. (Is there really still a dungeon?? Oh sure yea totally, watch out for those animals, all the dogs love a good scratch.)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>current Hot Rumors abt the royalty:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The emperor is courting one of the maids; no he’s courting one of the hunters. (There’s not much proof for either.)</li>
                    <li>He’s also seemed to have adopted a dog, but no one can prove it’s his either.</li>
                    <li>The princess snuck out for a few days [read: to meet up with whoever she’s interested in].</li>
                    <li>But the princess has a bad cold from sneaking out apparently; her bodyguard had to literally drag her back to her room when she tried to sneak out again. It was probably very embarrassing, considering her bodyguard threw her over her shoulder like a sack of potatoes.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Main Temples:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Overall, the main temples are beautiful and grand, and clearly have had a lot of money spent on them. They used to be supplemented by the ruling family, given money to fund programs to help those in need, but after the recent regime change of the religious leaders and the new Emperor, their funding has thinned down to a trickle, the Emperor instead beginning to implement his own programs to help those who need it.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Of course, the priests/priestesses were not too pleased with this development, but there’s been some notice that the programs the temples had weren’t as good as they used to be. Perhaps the Emperor also took notice?</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Market Square:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A large, squarish? or perhaps roundish--it’s hard to give it a good shape now that the buildings seem to be trying to overrun the open space--a rare open area in the city, left clear for the purpose of an open air market.</li>
                <li>there is a main street down the center of the city that leads right to the palace. it first leads to the market square, which widens out the street the rest of the way to the palace, the street acting as an extension of the square, market stalls lining it as well as shops before it goes into the temple district.</li>
                <li>lots of people like to stop here for lunch, on break from their jobs and wanting the fresh(?) air of the city as they visit with friends and/or get food</li>
                <li>the center of the square has a pretty fountain, which provides some more seating around its basin as well as clean, drinkable water, said to come straight from the palace</li>
            </ul>
