            Cavell City, Capitol
        </div>
   	    <p><strong>QUICK BACKGROUND -</strong><br>
        Cavell City is the capital city of Cavell, expanded far out beyond the walls of its former castle as tech progressed and jobs changed. It is still ruled by an Emperor or Empress, who reside in the Palace of Cavell City. Just recently, the crown prince has taken power and become the new Emperor after the untimely death of the Empress and consort. He and his twin sister do their best to rule over the land with the help of some very trusty advisors. The line of rulers has always been caring, taking to heart the fact there is no ruler without the people, and this new Emperor seems no different, even if he is still quite young.</p>
        <p><b>CAVELL</b><br>
        castle town/main city - (think like rome or athens in terms of old but still bustling and integrated tech into old buildings, and also in terms of dirt)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>very large city, has obviously greatly expanded over the years:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Inner Wall/Palace:</b> contains the palace and the wall around it. The palace used to be more of a castle in terms of defenses, having a wall as well as small windows and thick walls, but over the many years of Emperors and Empresses, the place has be renovated over and over to become far more open and airy, turning it into a palace rather than a castle. But there are still some remnants of the original building found in the ancient wall around the palace and the even more built over wall in the middle of the city.</li>
                <li><b>City:</b> just outside the inner wall from the original castle. This part of the city is the oldest, but is definitely full of the wealthier inhabitants of the city (good luck getting cheap real estate when the buildings have a bunch of land and are centuries old but almost always upgraded with the times). This is definitely where lords and people who work on designing new constructs live, and itâ€™s also where all the temples are located (along with most of the people who live in the temples). As the buildings go further away from the inner wall, the more cramped they become, obviously shoved together as close as they can to maximise the quickly overtaken space. These buildings go right up against the outer wall, some newer ones going over it.</li>
                <li><b>Outskirts:</b> outside the outer wall, the city expanded into towns around factories that eventually all ran into each other, and the buildings closest to the wall always look the most jumbled. The buildings out here however are newer, and often smaller to try to fit more into the space, although as you go out towards the edge the buildings start getting bigger as they have more space to develop. This is where most of the poorer folk live, and sometimes the factory owners as well if they desire to live near their factory (most do not).</li>
            </ul>
            <li>as you go into the city, the further into the city you go, the more tech you see, until you hit the palace, which has far more integrated/disguised tech to kind of meld both the old and the new</li>
            <li>a strange mix of old and new, the older part of the city has lots of references to the time when the caste was still a fortress, while the newer buildings flaunt the best technology of the time that helped make them</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Notable Places:</b>

        <br>
        <p><b>BASICS:</b></p>
        <p><i>Government:</i><br>
        led by the Emperor (or Empress) and advised by numerous officials, some elected and others having been there for centuries; the second most powerful people are the priests/clerics</p>
        <p><i>Geography/History:</i><br>
        in the edge of a valley, the palace is up against the water of a huge lake<br>
        fresh water comes from rivers and the lake as well as rain and snow; the surrounding area is mostly cleared forest for farms, but after the farms are woods that go up to the edge of the mountains; the mountains contain some mines which bring precious stones and crystals to fuel the magic refineries<br>
        the sprawling city used to be a castle fortress, and over the years has expanded out over the walls, turning it into a city of its own right as well as capital of the country</p>
        <p><i>Industry:</i><br>
        inhabitants have a wide range of jobs, from owning their own business to inventing new technology to serving a god; the city is a hub for trading, having a the largest port in the area</p>
