			Notable Places: Cavell City - Main Temples

            <li>Main Temples:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Overall, the main temples are beautiful and grand, and clearly have had a lot of money spent on them. They used to be supplemented by the ruling family, given money to fund programs to help those in need, but after the recent regime change of the religious leaders and the new Emperor, their funding has thinned down to a trickle, the Emperor instead beginning to implement his own programs to help those who need it.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Of course, the priests/priestesses were not too pleased with this development, but there’s been some notice that the programs the temples had weren’t as good as they used to be. Perhaps the Emperor also took notice?</li>
