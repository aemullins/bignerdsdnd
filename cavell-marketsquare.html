			Notable Places: Cavell City - Market Square

       	<ul>
            <li>Market Square:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A large, squarish? or perhaps roundish--itâ€™s hard to give it a good shape now that the buildings seem to be trying to overrun the open space--a rare open area in the city, left clear for the purpose of an open air market.</li>
                <li>there is a main street down the center of the city that leads right to the palace. it first leads to the market square, which widens out the street the rest of the way to the palace, the street acting as an extension of the square, market stalls lining it as well as shops before it goes into the temple district.</li>
                <li>lots of people like to stop here for lunch, on break from their jobs and wanting the fresh(?) air of the city as they visit with friends and/or get food</li>
                <li>the center of the square has a pretty fountain, which provides some more seating around its basin as well as clean, drinkable water, said to come straight from the palace</li>
            </ul>
