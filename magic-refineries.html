			Magic Refineries
		</div>
       	<p>about a day’s journey away from the city to the east and west; some farms divide the expanding city from these (small) towns</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A large factory surrounded by a factory town, a place only born for the convenience of people who work at the magic refinery. The refinery turns the ability to imbue crystals and other precious stones with magic into an industrialized process, able to be done by almost anyone.</li>
            <li>Housing</li>
            <ul>
                <li>mostly similar to suburbs around areas with businesses and schools and temples, made to be convenient to families who work at the factory</li>
                <li>everything is far more spread out than in the city, even more spread out than the outskirts of the city (basically the city is, super crammed in on itself). the town is small enough that people tend to walk places, though it isn’t unheard of to see a construct drawn carriage here or there</li>
                <li>school system is like the public school system in that you go to the school in your area, the town is small enough to probably only have two schools at maximum</li>
            </ul>
            <li>the factory town’s edges dissolve into farms, which go out for quite a ways, and have their own little farming villages</li>
        </ul>
