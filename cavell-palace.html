			Notable Places: Cavell City - Cavell Palace
		</div>
       	<ul>
        <li>Cavell Palace:</li>
            <ul>
            <li>A beautiful place, the architecture itself shows its majesty, making no need for gaudy decorations. The Emperors and Empresses of old decided to keep their money to help the city and its people instead of spending it on gaudy decorations, and since then it has been their heritage to continue with that example. (Some of the renovations of the castle were definitely made during a time when people were desperate for work.)</li>
            <li>It’s always bustling with workers, from servants to guards to advisors, making halls abuzz with conversation and gossip. There are also often cats (rat-catchers) and occasionally off-duty hunting dogs running around as well, usually causing trouble. At later hours the halls tend to quiet, but there’s almost always a few people running around doing various jobs even in the wee hours of the morning.</li>
            <li>It’s a grand place that has a lot of employees and is its own little community almost. (Some of the estates near the palace’s wall are similar, though a few are more abandoned. </li>
            <li>things told to new people in the palace:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The Emperor and his twin sister the Princess wander around the halls and look just like everyone else, so watch what you say.</li>
                <li>If you make eye contact with the Emperor while he sits on the throne you’ll be smited on the spot.</li>
                <li>The Princess has claimed all of the animals in the palace as her own so if you touch one you’ll be thrown in the dungeon. (Is there really still a dungeon?? Oh sure yea totally, watch out for those animals, all the dogs love a good scratch.)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>current Hot Rumors abt the royalty:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The emperor is courting one of the maids; no he’s courting one of the hunters. (There’s not much proof for either.)</li>
                <li>He’s also seemed to have adopted a dog, but no one can prove it’s his either.</li>
                <li>The princess snuck out for a few days [read: to meet up with whoever she’s interested in].</li>
                <li>But the princess has a bad cold from sneaking out apparently; her bodyguard had to literally drag her back to her room when she tried to sneak out again. It was probably very embarrassing, considering her bodyguard threw her over her shoulder like a sack of potatoes.</li>
